# 100 Days Of Code (first 100 days)

 I don't think 100 days will get me where I want to be - but it all starts with 100 days and a reassess.
 Knowledge without action isn't knowledge!
 First 100 days from May 25, 2024 when doing 6 days a week of coding is September 18, 2024

## Goals
- Work through the book Computer Science - an interdisciplinary approach by Sedgwick and Wayne (CSI)
- Learn Java and OOP concepts
- Start to put project ideas into code - as I learn to code I suspect these project ideas will get better and I'll have other ideas
    - the SFMA top tier to breakdown algorithms
    - An approach to assess a users propensity to commit causal inference fallacies
    - Data aquisition for Movesense IMU sensors for movement analysis app development

## Log
### Day 1: May 25, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Got Linux installed on Dell XPS 9520 laptop and installed IntellJ java IDE and VIM for use of CLI to get comfortable with terminal text editing for simple programs
**Thoughts**: Great to get started using Linux since it will force me to understand and interact with more of the computer architecture and is a good step towards building embedded and automated systems for clinical use
**Link to work**: All code for chapter 1 of CSI is being kept in the (repo called hello linked here)[https://github.com/scollinspt/hello]

### Day 2: May 26, 20204
**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, Programs 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3
**Thoughts**: Used IntellJ IDE today, should really try to get comfortable with Vim since it will be easier for small programs and it will be easier to change to IntellJ from Vim, than vice versa. There must be a reason why Vim is still popular!

### Day 3: May 28, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, program 1.2.4
**Thoughts**: Used Vim from the linux terminal,understand it's popularity. As you get comfortable with the flow its easier.

### Day 4: May 29, 2024
