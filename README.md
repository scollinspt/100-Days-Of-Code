# 100 Days Of Code

 - I don't think 100 days will get me where I want to be - but it all starts with 100 days and a reassess.
 - Knowledge without action is not knowledge!
 - First 100 days from **May 25, 2024** when doing 6 days a week of coding is **September 18, 2024**

## Goals

- Incorporate use of linux, github, the terminal window (CLI) and other development tools into my workflow
- Work through the book Computer Science - an interdisciplinary approach by Sedgewick and Wayne (CSI)
- Learn Java (CSI) and OOP concepts (books on OOPs philosophy and approach)
- Learn linear algebra from a computational perspective using either Java or Python
    - Python may be preferred as a interpreted language and the use of notebooks (will use Mike Cohen's book on linear algebra with Python)
- Start to put project ideas into code - as I learn to code I suspect these project ideas will get better and I'll have other ideas
    - The SFMA top tier to breakdown algorithms
    - An approach to assess a users propensity to commit causal inference fallacies
    - Data acquisition for Movesense IMU sensors for movement analysis app development
- Keep weekly logs [https://github.com/scollinspt/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/master/logs]

## Log

### Day 1: Saturday May 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Got Linux installed on Dell XPS 9520 laptop and installed IntellJ java IDE and VIM for use of CLI to get comfortable with terminal text editing for simple programs
**Thoughts**: Great to get started using Linux since it will force me to understand and interact with more of the computer architecture and is a good step towards building embedded and automated systems for clinical use
**Link to work**: All code for chapter 1 of CSI is being kept in the repo called hello linked here: [https://github.com/scollinspt/hello]

### Day 2: Monday May 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, Programs 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3
**Thoughts**: Used IntellJ IDE today, should really try to get comfortable with Vim since it will be easier for small programs and it will be easier to change to IntellJ from Vim, than vice versa. There must be a reason why Vim is still popular!

### Day 3: Tuesday May 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, program 1.2.4
**Thoughts**: Used Vim from the linux terminal, I now have a better understanding of it's popularity. As you get comfortable with the flow its easier to use than other text editors.

### Day 4: Wednesday May 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from section 1.4 of CSI including program 1.2.5 which was on type casting and an emphasis on the importance of data type, as well as the primitive data types in Java. 
**Thoughts**: Interesting to consider char as a primitives, and not strings, but it makes complete sense since strings are simply concatenated characters.

### Day 5: Thursday May 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Coded for several exercises at the end of section 1.2 of CSI
**Thoughts**: Good practice overall. There's something to be said for doing this every day - I'm already feeling more comfortable with the Vim and Git/Github workflow and the repetition of the java language. Even though they are very simple programs as a start, I can see how the daily routine leads to an understanding. Once I get through chapter 1 I'll start adding code to this repository under projects with each chapter being a project.

### Day 6: Friday May 31, 2024

**Today's Progress**:Worked up to - but not through - Exercise 1.2.19 in CSI. Got stuck on a program to generate a pseudorandom integer between two values that are entered as command line arguments. I'll think about this overnight and revisit tomorrow.
**Thoughts**: Doing the exercises and not rushing through them is an important part of this journey that I've never actually stuck to in the past. I'm hoping it makes the difference.

### Day 7: Saturday June 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSI section 1.2 exercises. Decided to stop - but did go over an hour. Just don't want to risk getting burnt out after just one week. In this for the long haul, and have not ever made it the full 100 days before. I think the reason I have never made it is that I haven't kept to the plan of just an hour (or maybe a bit over or under an hour). I don't feel the need to do the creative exercises - at this stage I understand data types very well and want to move onto section 1.3 on conditionals and loops.
**Thoughts**: Pretty much had my thoughts above. I'm not sure whether I'll actually take a day off tomorrow. But I'm going to try. It's good for learning, and good for sustaining for the long haul.
