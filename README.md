# 100 Days Of Code

 - I don't think 100 days will get me where I want to be - but it all starts with 100 days and a reassess.
 - Knowledge without action is not knowledge!
 - First 100 days from **May 25, 2024** when doing 6 days a week of coding is **September 18, 2024**

## Goals

- Incorporate use of linux, github, the terminal window (CLI) and other development tools into my workflow
- Work through the book Computer Science - an interdisciplinary approach by Sedgewick and Wayne (CSI)
- Learn Java (CSI) and OOP concepts (books on OOPs philosophy and approach)
- Learn linear algebra from a computational perspective using either Java or Python
    - Python may be preferred as a interpreted language and the use of notebooks (will use Mike Cohen's book on linear algebra with Python)
- Start to put project ideas into code - as I learn to code I suspect these project ideas will get better and I'll have other ideas
    - The SFMA top tier to breakdown algorithms
    - An approach to assess a users propensity to commit causal inference fallacies
    - Data acquisition for Movesense IMU sensors for movement analysis app development
- Keep weekly logs [https://github.com/scollinspt/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/master/logs]

## Log

### Day 1: May 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Got Linux installed on Dell XPS 9520 laptop and installed IntellJ java IDE and VIM for use of CLI to get comfortable with terminal text editing for simple programs
**Thoughts**: Great to get started using Linux since it will force me to understand and interact with more of the computer architecture and is a good step towards building embedded and automated systems for clinical use
**Link to work**: All code for chapter 1 of CSI is being kept in the repo called hello linked here: [https://github.com/scollinspt/hello]

### Day 2: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, Programs 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3
**Thoughts**: Used IntellJ IDE today, should really try to get comfortable with Vim since it will be easier for small programs and it will be easier to change to IntellJ from Vim, than vice versa. There must be a reason why Vim is still popular!

### Day 3: May 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on code from CSI chapter 1, program 1.2.4
**Thoughts**: Used Vim from the linux terminal, I now have a better understanding of it's popularity. As you get comfortable with the flow its easier to use than other text editors.
