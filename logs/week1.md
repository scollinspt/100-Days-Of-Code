# Week 1

## May 25, 2024 through May 31, 2024

Accomplished a lot this week with the addition of a Linux computer to my workflow - someday maybe I'll be free of both Apple and Windows for my computing needs! Well, that's pretty nearly impossible, but it's something to hope for at least in my life. 

In addition to getting linux running on the Dell XPS laptop, I'm using github from the CLI. I never should have stopped that, it's the most pure way to use github and the best way to get better at it. The apps just make me lazy and I forget basic functionality. On that note, I'm going to continue to try to use Vim as my programming text editor because it makes the entire process more intentional and less dependent on a particular IDE. If I want to learn the underlying structure of the computer architecture for while code is written (linux) then I should use a text editor like Vim that keeps me from using systems that are placed between me and the computer doing work for me.

Working my way through the exercises has been fulfilling and helps to solidify the learning. Even though it's a struggle at times - it is through these struggles that I recognize the areas I need work on. So far my logic training has been very helpful, I'm very comfortable with the Boolean type and all operations using that type. However, I  struggle a bit more with the random numbers and - for instance - the exercise that is stumping me at the moment is Ex 1.2.19 - generating a random integer between two values that a user enters at the command line. It's easy to do so from 0 to an upper value. But establishing that lower value is more difficult. But I think it's actually easy and I'm just tired - - so the morning will tell me more.
